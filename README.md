# love-island-workshop
A repository containing all resources to learn about Python Data Visualisation and calling machine learning APIs (Text Analytics)

This workshop uses a personally collected Love Island TV series dataset about contestants from 2016 - 2019. Also some tweets collected during the show we can analyse.

### So lets get started! ....


# Python Data Visualisation

Open the **love-island-workbook** file (.py if you are running in an IDE or .ipynb if you are running in a Jupyter Notebook environment).

This file contains pre-populated code to walk through and sections where you can write your own code and solve the challenges

Feel free to add and run your own code within this file - this is your workbook space to try out what your learning about Data Visualisation

## If Running in Azure Notebooks

* Log into Azure Notebooks using an Azure Subscription
* Create new project from Github Repository
* Clone the repository using the URL within the Green Button at the top of this repository and view the files
* Choose 'Run on Free Compute' and view the directory open in a Jupyter Interface 
* Click the 'love-island-workshop.ipynb' file to open
* run the notebook using control SHIFT + ENTER

## If Running using Jupyter Locally

* Create a folder on your machine with the resources downloaded using the Green button at the top of this repository
* Run 'Jupyter' program on your local machine
* wait for the Jupyter server to start within the command line
* A web browser window should open with your documents
* Browse to the folder with the resources
* Select the 'love-island-workbook.ipynb' file and it will open in a new browser tab
* run the notebook using control SHIFT + ENTER


## If Running using VS Code

*  Create a folder on your machine with the resources downloaded using the Green button at the top of this repository
* Open Visual Studio Code and install the Python extension by Microsoft from the Extensions tab on the left
* Open the folder containing the code using File -> Open
* Double click the 'love-island-workbook.py' file to open it
* Once open to run the code choose SHIFT + ENTER or select a set of line of code, right click and run seleted lines in Terminal

## If Running using Spyder
