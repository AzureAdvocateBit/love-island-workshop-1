# love-island-workshop
A repository containing all resources to learn about Python Data Visualisation and calling machine learning APIs (Text Analytics)

This workshop uses a personally collected Love Island TV series dataset about contestants from 2016 - 2019. Also some tweets collected during the show we can analyse.

### So lets get started! ....


# Python Data Visualisation

Open the **love-island-workbook** file (.py if you are running in an IDE or .ipynb if you are running in a Jupyter Notebook environment).

This file contains pre-populated code to walk through and sections where you can write your own code and solve the challenges

Feel free to add and run your own code within this file - this is your workbook space to try out what your learning about Data Visualisation


> If you are stuck feel free to look at the **love-island-completed-code** or **love-island-completed-notebook** files to see how I have solved the problem


# Calling Machine Learning Web APIs
