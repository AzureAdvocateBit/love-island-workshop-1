2019-06-23T13:00:00.000Z,1.14278E+18,"On a scale of 1 to Anton, how excited are you for #LoveIsland tonight? 9pm on @VirginMedia_Two!"

2019-06-23T16:31:09.000Z,1.14283E+18,Michael is a true friend I love it
2019-06-23T21:50:32.000Z,1.14291E+18,Did Michael not say the exact same thing about Maura moments before Tom?So disappointed!
2019-06-24T06:21:06.000Z,1.14304E+18,"Molly-Mae, Amber and Anna are my fave girls in there #loveisland"
2019-06-25T12:05:57.000Z,1.14349E+18,"Molly-Mae didn't straight away show her affection towards Tommy until Maura came and had a meltdown. No says anything but Yewande is in the same predicament, gives a little attitude and labelled as bitter Nonsense #loveisland"
2019-06-23T12:05:43.000Z,1.14277E+18,I'm happy Danny's head has been turned. He deserves someone that's actually nice to him. 
2019-06-23T00:24:56.000Z,1.14259E+18,I said it in the beginning and I'll say it again. Danny is disingenuous and can't be trusted. 
2019-06-23T02:42:27.000Z,1.14262E+18,Am I the only person that thinks Lucie and Tommy really would make a better couple #LoveIsland
2019-06-23T10:14:26.000Z,1.14274E+18,"Tommy is useless, he was seriously trying to cut ice with a knife #loveisland"
