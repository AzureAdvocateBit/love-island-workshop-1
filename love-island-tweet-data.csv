"@CurtisPritchard @amyhart1707 you guys are so cute, you guys are one of my favourite @LoveIsland couples #curtispritchard #amyhart #curtisandamy #LoveIsland"
poor Curtis man the poor bloke  #Loveisland
Amber and Anna are the friends we all need #LoveIsland
Seeing Amber and Anna cry just literarily made me cry  #Loveisland
"On a scale of 1 to Anton, how excited are you for #LoveIsland tonight? 9pm on @VirginMedia_Two!"
@LoveIsland All this going on and poor Anton still has no one bless him #LoveIsland
Michael is a true friend I love it
Did Michael not say the exact same thing about Maura moments before Tom?So disappointed!
"Molly-Mae, Amber and Anna are my fave girls in there #loveisland"
"Molly-Mae didn't straight away show her affection towards Tommy until Maura came and had a meltdown. No says anything but Yewande is in the same predicament, gives a little attitude and labelled as bitter Nonsense #loveisland"
I'm happy Danny's head has been turned. He deserves someone that's actually nice to him. 
I said it in the beginning and I'll say it again. Danny is disingenuous and can't be trusted. 
Am I the only person that thinks Lucie and Tommy really would make a better couple #LoveIsland
"Tommy is useless, he was seriously trying to cut ice with a knife #loveisland"
